https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgkgQtMplPY&list=LL&index=133 

Build an Authentication/Login System on AWS with React.js and a Serverless API - Part 2 (frontend):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReNkQ0Xkccw&list=LL&index=131

Implementation:
The agenda of the above project is to implement the client and server.  
FRONT-END REACT:
Create endpoints: The frontend is built with react.js and is hosted on an AWS S3 bucket.
Register: There we can use for registering the new account.
Login: Then we the login endpoint there to authenticate the user.

Backend:
Integrate frontend with backend, The backend is a node.js serverless API with a DynamoDB for user information storage. It uses bcrypt to encrypt passwords and uses JWT to generate tokens.


Note:
1. Execute the above by watching the above videos and implement in your local machines. 
2. Create a Github Repo and upload your code and create a Readme.md file that contains the steps to execute your program
3. The readme should contain all the steps, including your installation, execution of the project end to end. And also any troubleshooting steps you have taken to resolve the errors.
4. Create an Architecture Diagram of the above implementation of all the services and tools and upload the diagram in GitHub (Please don’t take a snapshot of the architecture from the video and use third party tools like lucid chats or draw.io to do one). 
5. Everyone complete this by EOD i.e., by Jan 14’th 2024 11:59 PM and sent the GitHub link to Shiv and show implementation by tomorrow morning(Jan 15’th 2024).
